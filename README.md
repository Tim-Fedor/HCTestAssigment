# HCTestAssigment
This demo project is a HyperCasual assignment. The player has three factories. Each of them made unique resources and needed other (or not) resources for work.
The player needs to manage resources between factories for correct work and for making more rare resources.
The main idea of this assignment is to use as few as possible ready-made assets. So the only one I use - is the simple 2D sprite joystickâ€”even the factory models I made myself in Blender.
